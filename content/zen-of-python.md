## The Zen of Python

One of the most influential and elegantly written guidelines in the world of programming. A reminder that programming is not just about getting things to work, it's also about doing so in a way that is clean, logical, and elegant. I find it quite philosophical and applicable to other areas in life as well. 

> Beautiful is better than ugly.  
> Explicit is better than implicit.  
>  
> Simple is better than complex.  
> Complex is better than complicated.  
>  
> Flat is better than nested.  
> Sparse is better than dense.  
>  
> Readability counts.  
> Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.  
>  
> Although practicality beats purity.  
> Errors should never pass silently.  
> Unless explicitly silenced.  
>  
> In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.  
> There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.  
> Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.  
>  
> Now is better than never.  
> Although never is often better than *right* now.  
>  
> If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.  
> If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.  
> Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those.
