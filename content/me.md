Hey, I'm Rohit! 
I’m a London-based quantitative software developer with experience building high-performance trading and analytical systems. 
My work sits at the intersection of quantitative modeling, software engineering, and product design.
Over the years, I’ve architected and delivered complex systems for leading institutions across investment banking, hedge funds, commodities market making, and the gaming industry (my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rohitmungre)). 

My experience includes:
- Designing trading system architecture for real-time OTC trade execution 
- Developing quant analytics library supporting yield curve construction
- Automating real-time hedging and risk management
- Implementing pricing, risk, and execution models 
- Machine learning for modelling market behavior 
- Engineering low-latency, high-throughput compute pipelines

This site is a blend of personal journal, professional updates, and a way to stake my corner of the internet. I built it while learning React — with AI as a co-pilot along the way.
