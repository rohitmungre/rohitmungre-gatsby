Over the past 13 years, I have developed expertise in building quantitative and analytical systems across industries including investment banking, hedge funds, commodity trading, and gaming. My work has involved designing pricing models, creating high-performance trading systems, integrating real-time data, and building scalable microservices-based platforms. I have deployed and managed applications on Kubernetes and enhanced observability using Grafana, Prometheus, and Loki.

At Onyx Capital Group, I designed pricing models, built trading & risk management systems, and architected scalable microservices for an OTC trading platform. Additionally, I implemented statistical outlier detection frameworks and enhanced observability systems.

During my tenure at Squarepoint Capital, I led the development of a quantitative analytical library for fixed income instruments, generating various kinds of yield curves and pricing fixed income instruments like bonds, swaps etc.

While working with Deutsche Bank, I spearheaded quantitative development for Corporate Bank solutions managing over 100 Billion EUR worth of current accounts, implemented analytics for liquidity stress methodology, and built tools for efficient risk management.

My early experience at Bwin.Party Digital Entertainment involved developing backend systems for real-time multiplayer gaming, enhancing bonus systems, and ensuring seamless data processing.
